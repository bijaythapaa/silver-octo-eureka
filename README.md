# silver-octo-eureka
a simple RESTful API created using Django REST Framework(DRF), the key feature is: a User can send an issue to the server and then Admin can respond to the issue.

(Actually, It's an assignment to me. A company which I was interviewed with asked to me do this project. Here I am just trying to hack the concept of it, however if I enjoyed this, I will take to advanced level, so for now I will just do the concept.)

I'll add step-by-step guidelines for you to clone this repo and run on your local computer.
For now, you can see my codes.

wish you **Happy New Year :)**
